                    <p>This man made water reservoir located inside the Fort Magsaysay, 
                        serves as the relaxation place of our soldiers from the pressure 
                        in their line of work.
                        They say that by staring at any body of water can relax your body
                        and mind. So it’s very effective to relax here.
                        Another thing, If there is reservoir there is falls. 
                        Who wouldn’t want to go to the falls right? Go for a swim 
                        and jump from it’s peak to the lagoon.</p>
